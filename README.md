# VPNManager

VPN Manager for Linux.
-----------

A better way to use NordVPN and others VPNs (paid|free).

- Update apt-get: "sudo apt-get updade".
- Install openVPN: "sudo apt-get install openvpn".
- Run VPNManager as root or normal user (to connect, you'll be prompted to insert root pass).
- Select the folder where the configuration files are (.ovpn, .key, .crt, .pem).
- With only .ovpn is possible to get connected (just select the .ovpn from the first list of files and leave the others unselected).
